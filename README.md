# lightweight-browser
A Chromium based browser that's super barebones and uses less than 300MB of RAM for Windows

## Why did I make this?
I wanted to make a browser for gamers on low end systems but still keep modern functionality, localhost support, and developer tools accessible while not compromising on multitasking, performance, or security. 

## Features
- AdBlocker & SponsorBlock Baked in
- Caches forms so you don't have to login all the time using LocalStorage
- Uses duckduckgo for reduced tracking
- EXTREMELY low footprint
- Tabs are supported
- Chromium based
- Attempts to use dark mode on all websites
- Performance Optimizations for low end systems (Reduces GPU usage substantially, great for iGPUs)
- Extremely quick loading

## Contributing
Feel free to fork and push some cool updates. Who knows, maybe I'll add them ðŸ˜Š

## License
Feel free to reuse, must ask to use commerically or for profit though.

## Features coming later
I'll be adding an installer and updater eventually. For now you can download the files and just use `npm start` in the folder,
