# Lightweight Browser
A blazing-fast, super-light Chromium-based browser using under 300MB RAM built for low-end PCs.

## Demo Website
There is a demo website but it does not function as a browser. It just simply shows what the app looks like.

## Why I Made This
I got tired of browsers eating up all my resources, especially when gaming on low-end systems. So I built a no-bloat, privacy-minded browser that doesnâ€™t sacrifice developer tools, localhost support, or modern features but still keeps your system snappy and secure.

## Why this browser?
If youâ€™re tired of browsers that:

- Devour your RAM and GPU resources

- Fill your pages with ads, trackers, and bloat

- Fail to run smoothly on integrated or older GPUs

- Donâ€™t respect your privacy or time

This browser is your no-nonsense, fast alternative that puts performance and privacy first with gaming-friendly resource management.

## Features
### Core
- Chromium-based for wide compatibility and modern web standards

- Under 300MB RAM usage even with multiple tabs open

- Tabs supported with smooth switching via Electron BrowserViews

- Dark mode injected into every webpage via custom CSS

- Built-in AdBlocker & SponsorBlock integration using ghostery adblocker and custom SponsorBlock injection for YouTube videos

- DuckDuckGo as default search engine for privacy and reduced tracking

- Smart URL input: navigates directly or searches via DuckDuckGo

- LocalStorage-based form caching to keep you logged in across sessions (implemented on a per-site basis)

- GPU optimizations: disables unnecessary GPU usage to boost FPS on iGPUs and low-end graphics hardware

### Technical
- Electron IPC architecture separating UI (renderer) and main browser logic

- Dynamic tab management: create, switch, and navigate tabs seamlessly

- SponsorBlock API integration skips sponsored segments on YouTube automatically

- CSS injection for dark mode and reduced UI clutter on sites

- Graceful fallback on adblocking failures silently logs errors without breaking pages

## Installation & Usage

You need to download NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download (You should see "Or get a prebuilt Node.jsÂ® for Windows running a x64 architecture.", just click download .msi and run it. NodeJS is safe and used by governments, schools, banks, even Google and Microsoft.) Once you've done that do the following:

- Download this repo

- Run in the root directory:
```
npm install
```
Wait until it finishes and run:
```
npm start
```
Thatâ€™s it. Your lightweight, speedy browser launches ready to roll.

## Planned Features
- Native installer and auto-updater

- Enhanced UI and theming options

- Extended custom blocklists and user script support

- Better localStorage management for session persistence
